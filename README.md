# NASA-NEAR_EARTH-OBJECT-NEO-
Creating an app to track Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) Program can be a fun and educational project! This app can provide insights into how many asteroids come near Earth, their size, velocity, speed, and other relevant data. The app can fetch data from NASAâ€™s NEO API and display it in an easy-to-understand way.
